PROBLEM STAREMENT :
Many times we decide some dish in our mind but when we search it online, we realise we don’t even have all the ingredients for that recipe. So again we waste time searching something else. 
Because of this small but annoying problem, I made this simple app where you can just type the ingredients you already have, and it will show few Indian recipes that match. The goal is 
just to save time and make cooking choice a bit easier for normal users.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
Suggest recipes only from a fixed list of Indian dishes.
Search and match based on ingredients typed by the user.
Show ingredients and   cooking steps  in short for each dish.
Simple Tkinter-based interface, nothing too fancy.


TARGET USERS :
Students or beginners who get confused what to cook.
People living in hostel/PG with limited ingredients.
Anyone who wants quick and simple recipe ideas.

HIGH LEVEL FEATURES :
You can type ingredients you already have, and the app shows recipes that match those ingredients.
Shows top 3  matching dishes.
Button to view full recipe steps.
Clean and basic GUI using Tkinter.
Offline Python project.
